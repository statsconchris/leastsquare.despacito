## The least squares method with Despacito
We develop the method of least squares using differential calculus. Then we apply it to determine, through linear extrapolation, the date on which Despacito becomes the most viewed video on YouTube. The numerical calculations were done in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

**Instructions**

For the teams that qualified to the intercontinental playoffs, we plot the FIFA ranking position vs. time and compute a linear approximation using `Scipy stats.linregress()`.

- Download `least-squares.ipynb` or `least-squares-styled.ipynb` and run. The latter adds some style to the graphs
