### A Python code (.ipynb) to predict the future of Despacito considering linear extrapolation and the method of least squares

The files run in Jupyter Notebook. There are 2 files: 

1. leastsquares_full_EN.ipynb : A code with personalized graphs.
2. leastsquares_simple_EN.ipynb : A code with default graphs.

An introduction to the analysis given in the code is shown in the article: [nepy.pe/en/extrapolation.despacito.](http://www.nepy.pe/en/education/linear-extrapolation-to-predict-the-future-of-despacito/) 

A complete analysis is given in the tutorial: [nepy.pe/en/leastsquares.despacito.](http://www.nepy.pe/en/tutorial/least-squares-method/)
