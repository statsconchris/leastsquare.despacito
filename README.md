## The least squares method with Despacito
We develop the least squares method using differential calculus. Then we apply it to determine, through linear extrapolation, the date on which Despacito becomes the most viewed video on YouTube. The numerical calculations were done in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

**Instructions**

- Download `least-squares.ipynb` or `least-squares-styled.ipynb` and run. The latter adds some style to the graphs.
